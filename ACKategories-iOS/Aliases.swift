/// As _ACKategories-iOS_ does not embed _ACKategoriesCore_ in Carthage distribution (so it is simpler to develop and also to integrate),
/// we need to somehow bridge types from _ACKategoriesCore_ in other distribution channels, this is the purpose of this file,
/// so it should be part of SwiftPM and Cocoapods distributions, but not compiled with Carthage distribution.
